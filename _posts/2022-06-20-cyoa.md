## The Adventure Begins
### Pg. 1
The trees grow deeply here, shadowing the halloways, moss creeping beneath. You step lightly out of both caution and reverence. The circle is only a little farther. Why are you here?

- I did not choose to be. My family wanted the respect of having a child in the circle, no matter the cost. (Pg. 5)
- I made my choice. I will be the foundation on which my beloved people thrive. (Pg. 3)

### Pg. 3
The trees rustle like breath, welcoming you in with open arms. Or open branches, you think with laughter. Of course they would welcome you. You are coming home, home to the roots on which your people build their lives. It is quiet here in the manner of a temple. It is only right. 

### Pg. 4

### Pg. 5
The trees rustle like breath. You shudder at the thought. How long have they grown here? How long have your people lived around the circle? You realise at the thought of life that you can hear no birds. The silence cradles you, times your breaths in and out, following your footsteps.
