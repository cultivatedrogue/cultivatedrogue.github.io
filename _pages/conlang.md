# Worldbuilding
I picture this area as an slightly inland mountainous region near a large river. Monsoons are seasonal. Winter is very mild by the river, but dangerous on the slopes. Technology is neither modern nor historical. Generally pre-industrial except for more advanced material/ chemical science, and mechanical power gained from the river put to more uses. The language features VSO order, with emphasis on aspect. Very fine distinctions are made in the prepositions, comparatively little in the pronouns. It derives from a proto-language highly inflected in modals with more permissive phonology. Noun gender is animate(abstract)/ inanimate (concrete). Ideas, concepts, ‘higher’ animals, celestial bodies, and humans are considered animate, objects and ‘lower’ animals are considered inanimate.

Unusual cultural features include 
belief in partite paternity
Pratice of an australian walkabout for all young adults whose families are above abject poverty. Youth leave for their walkabout when they feel the time is right, or when their mother tells them they’re stalling. All towns in a wide radius keep haylofts for the wanderers. Wanderers generally return after a year or two. Pre-walkabout individuals are considered competent children, post-walkabouts are considered full adults and citizens. Wanderers must work for their bread. Farmers love them because they will happily work for a season for no pay but soup, bread, and hayloft. There is however the high likelihood of them vanishing in the night on you. A dull roar of debauchery is fully expected of wanderers, but thieves are not treated with mercy. If news that a child of their family committed violence on walkabout reaches the wanderer’s family, the youth will most likely be summoned before members of their house to explain themselves. If they are found animal they may be disinheirited of the House, and other Houses notified, leaving their only real paths forward to either work for another member of the house, hope that their friends are willing to take them in, or to exile themselves.
Large adoptive family groups being the main structure of society. Most justice is done within the houses, or gatherings of houses for important cases. Business and careers are usually done through family connections. Powerful and wealthy houses practice endless politicing, and would do more were it not for the tight bonds of marriage between every house. It is possible and common to be adopted into more than one house. Being associated with a disreputable house is a difficult stain on a reputation to remove. Best to disown the house, and/or befriend someone from another. The tangle of houses is considered the true mark of culture, and people take great joy in it. 
(At least, those with the skill to exploit the connections.) 
Equal-rights polyandry is a common practice, polygyny is less common. Most children have multiple fathers.
Name structure: House name - Given Name - (Grandmother’s given name)-Mother’s given name- Mother’s family name -   Ex:  a young man called by his friends Gaatu, of House Nichevegit could have as full name : Nichevegit gaatu Kilete Ryagi Barileves.
His mother’s name was Nichevegit ryagi Psoina Barileves
His father’s name when born was Nichevegit dzugura Natani Verain Meshemet, after marraige was Nichevegit dzugura Natani Verain Meshemet Barileves.
The shortest formal way of writing gaatu’s name is Nichevegit gaatu Barileves
Capitalisation represents formal script. Family trees are very easy to make, except for marking every time Houses join. Houses keep geneologies. 
Members within a House refer to each other as sisters and brothers, but marriage within the same House is very common. Marriage withing the same family name, even if it is to who in Western culture would be referred to as a kissing cousin, is considered completely unacceptable.
Inheritance of land falls generally, but by no means universally, to the youngest child, on the condition that they take care of their parents in their old age. Houses will often, true to their name, own land, building enough space to keep the entire House on site. (similar to Pacific Islander family compounds.) Inheritance is simplified by daughters having multiple husbands, fusing land. 
Even if a child is born to a longtime family of a House, they are not guaranteed a part as an adult. Children of House families are welcome, but are not members until accepted after their walkabout. Non-noble Houses have considerably less power, accept all children, and generally act like a large extended family.
Those without a House to their name are somewhat discriminated against, or distrusted. Many people born to high-class families were not skilled or connected or liked enough to be accepted into the House of their birth. Houses give many opportunities, but it is very possible to find employment elsewhere. The Houseless tend to be either very educated or very uneducated, high-class or unpleasant to deal with (or both). Middle-class Houses, because Houses do not generally split money, are always welcoming new people.
The most common religion of the area is closest to Taoism in social norms, or Hinduism in belief in many supernatural entities similar to humans and belief in reincarnation. 
Open spaces spaces are revered as sources of revelation or challenge. The concept of ‘Open spaces’ does not translate well into English. Wilderness may be closer, but not all wilderness is an open space. Mountains (Hitoikang), deserts, oceans, sky, and dangerously untamed forests are all considered open spaces. A better word may be non-human spaces. Rivers, safe forests, most plains, mountains (Ihedang) and all towns are not open spaces.
Hawks are considered secret-keepers and levelers of fate. Powerful people fear hawks, destitute people revere them. Capturing a hawk and forcing it to reveal its secrets is both seen as possible and suicidal.

POSSESIVE MODIFIER IS FI-
GENDER
Inanimate gender: 
Animate gender:
inanimate is converted to animate by adding -n if the last syllable has a stop, -r, -l, or -s otherwise
animate is converted to inanimate by adding the same vowel as the first syllable
(vowel harmony)
These rules only apply for derivations, Ri- added before an inanimate word makes it animate
To convert a Ri- word to inanimate add -t, or -it if the word ends in a vo
The adjective ending -dor removes any gender markings
Abstract concepts and celestial bodies are nearly always marked as animate
I.e. Death  -  Samang,  Corpse/carcass  -  Samanga
Gender distinction animate/ inanimate, or abstract/ concrete, mental/ physical

General nouns converted to specific nouns with -t / -it  ie. Richera - observant (person), to Richerat, observant-thing.  -t / -it removes ambiguity , in Vashu - water, Vashut - water-thing, ice


Ex:
Nipa  -  Nipan
Pidara  -  Pidaras
Samang  -  Samanga
Levasho  -  Levashos
Dagyon  -  Dagyona
Litsun  -  Litsuni
Selador  -  Seladore

Capitalisation Conventions
celestial bodies are written in formal script, transliterated as capitals
Also in formal script are:
Titles (this culture has many titles, most people have several)
Family names 
Names of honored dead (ie. historic general, your aunt, your friend’s 7*great-grandfather, but not the thief who stole your grandma’s horse 60 years ago)
Certain ancient cities
The river

Not in formal script are:
Personal names
Most places
Loanwords


Example names: Family names tend to have unusual phonotactics
Names with fronted vowels and unvoiced consonants are diminuative
Backed/long vowels and voicedness are considered augmentative
Neither of these are necessarily feminine or masculine, but a parent would not want to name their gentle, sweet, petite daughter Dzugura, despite the feminine sound it has to English speakers. (or their tall, strapping young lad named Kilete, despite the neutral sound to english)
Names with a mix of these features are generally gender-neutral, unless a well-known historical figure of relevant gender had the name, in which case the meaning is tinged.
LIberu niche
Meshemet bsenit (much less common)
Barileves gaatu (‘those of the river’  ‘plenty’, similar to John Smith in ubiquity)
Dezanadi rigedei 
Psoina natani
Dzugura
Kilete



plurals of modern words are formed with a prefix
plurals of older words with first syllable reduplication, where (generally) the first syllable is unvoiced and the second voiced. If it is easier to pronounce otherwise, it usually shifted.
Sounds permitted only at word onset stay at word onset.
In words 3 syllables or longer, archaic plurals can drop syllables
Examples:
Cat  -  kagat (cats)
Dog  -  todog (dogs)
Apple  -  Apabel (apples)
Banana  -  pabana (bananas)
Caterpillar  -  kagatepila (caterpillars)

No dummy subjects, 
Either implied subjects (ie ‘Raining.’ (Clouds? Sky? Who knows.)
Or lexicalized placeholders are used. (i.e.  ‘It’s raining’ vs ‘The sky is raining’)
It’s nice out vs The air is gentle

Spoken language has optional lexicalized handsigns, generally only used in very social/ friendly company, not in professional settings. Handsigns generally express emotional nuance and spacial position. Suddenly refusing to use hand signs in a good circumstance when the other person is using them is akin to responding with sudden formality and coldness to a friend. 
The word for cold, rude, petty, passive-aggression , especially between friends and family, is
Neg-hand-instrumentative, in adjective form Neg-hand-inst-adj

PRONOUNS:

No gender distinction
Optional plural, only used in archaic and legal settings
Inclusive and exclusive I/ we by animate/ inanimate gender
Optional Open Class, generally first syllable (ie Alex, Bob, and Charlie all went to the store. They both bought fruit, but he bought bread. VS Alex, Bob, and Charlie went to the store. Al/Char fruit bought, Bob bread bought)

WIND AND SUN
The North Wind and the Sun had a quarrel about which of them was the stronger. 
N and S had a fight about who was stronger.
 
Shikaiwa/ Ratiwa Shei Sheverai o Verang    batyo         by strong or not strong
Spoke      north wind    and sun    not-together    epe tagba e
While they were disputing with much heat and bluster, a Traveler passed along the road 
wrapped in a cloak.
And-light N/S spoke (using) no-hand and path-against, Shavar go(same direction) path
using in-cloth.
 
"Let us agree," said the Sun, "that he is the stronger who can strip that Traveler of his cloak.""Very well," growled the North Wind, and at once sent a cold, howling blast against the Traveler.With the first gust of wind the ends of the cloak whipped about the Traveler's body. But he immediately wrapped it closely around him, and the harder the Wind blew, the tighter he held it to him. The North Wind tore angrily at the cloak, but all his efforts were in vain.
Then the Sun began to shine. At first his beams were gentle, and in the pleasant warmth after the bitter cold of the North Wind, the Traveler unfastened his cloak and let it hang loosely from 
his shoulders. The Sun's rays grew warmer and warmer. The man took off his cap and mopped 
his brow. At last he became so heated that he pulled off his cloak, and, to escape the blazing 
sunshine, threw himself down in the welcome shade of a tree by the roadside.
